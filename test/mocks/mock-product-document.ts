Can be used at temperatures up to 500�C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods.
